## Overview of UFO Sighting Analysis
We were tasked with helping create a dynamic webpage that would display UFO sighting data based on criteria specified by user input. This webpage was created to filter the UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and shape.

## Summary of UFO Sighting Analysis

### Drawback
The main drawback to this webpageâ€™s design that sticks out is what the search criteria will accept and what the user will know what to search. If the user capitalizes the city, state, or country like many would, the search will come back empty. The user would also have to look through the full table in order to find what the values they could search for in the form.

### Further Web Page Development
- In order to help address the drawback pointed out, I would suggest creating the filters as a drop down option so the user knows exactly what is available to search and the format that would be accepted.
- Another development would be making each column sortable. Right now the user only has the option to view the order by date. If the user wanted to find the sightings with the longest duration for their search they would still have additional work to find which sightings had the longest duration.
